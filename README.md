## TCS3472-Pi-Pico
This library includes a simple class to get data and calibrate a connected TCS34725 Color light sensor. It is only tested on the Raspberry Pi Pico (H) with micropython 1.19.1, but it should work on all newer versions of micropython and other boards, that support micropython and I2C.
